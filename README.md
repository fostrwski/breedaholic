## Back story

When I was little I loved reading books about dogs. Might sound silly but I really did! I'd also get up early and watch the "101 Dogs" TV series before getting ready to go to the pre-school haha. Over 10 years later here I'm searching for an engaging and interesting project to create that'd help me develop new front-end skills and sharpen up the existing ones. I realize I can connect what I was really into in the past with what I like now and that's how it all started with Breedaholic!
